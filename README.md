- Considers group size and context for personalized suggestions

### Real-time Messaging
Built on Firebase Firestore with:
- Real-time message synchronization
- Read receipts and message status
- Direct messages and group conversations
- Integration with location services for context-aware messaging

### Privacy & Security
